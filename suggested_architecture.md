## Suggested Architecture: Maximizing Tsercom's Potential

While Tsercom supports straightforward client-server setups (as demonstrated in the Quick Start guide), its design truly shines in more dynamic, distributed environments. A powerful and recommended architecture involves a "client-advertises, server-discovers" model. This approach flips the traditional roles, offering significant flexibility and resilience.

In this model:

*   **Tsercom "Client" (Acts as a Data Source/Provider):**
    *   **Runs its own gRPC Server:** Instead of just initiating connections, each data source (e.g., a sensor, a data processing node, a machine learning model server) hosts its own gRPC service. This service is typically managed as a Tsercom `Runtime`.
    *   **Advertises its Service:** The Tsercom "Client" uses an `InstancePublisher` (leveraging mDNS/ZeroConf) to announce its presence and service details (like its IP address, port, and unique `CallerId`) on the local network. This makes it discoverable without needing a central registry or pre-configured addresses.
    *   **Managed by `RuntimeManager`:** The setup, including the gRPC server and the `InstancePublisher`, is often orchestrated using Tsercom's `RuntimeManager` along with a custom `RuntimeInitializer`. This encapsulates the communication logic.
    *   **Persistent Identity:** A `CallerIdentifier` is used to ensure this data source maintains a consistent, recognizable identity across restarts or network changes.

*   **Tsercom "Server" (Acts as a Data Aggregator/Consumer):**
    *   **Discovers Data Sources:** The Tsercom "Server" (e.g., a central data logger, an analytics dashboard, a training job coordinator) uses an `InstanceListener` to dynamically discover available Tsercom "Clients" (data sources) on the network by listening for their mDNS advertisements.
    *   **Connects as a gRPC Client:** Upon discovering a data source, the Tsercom "Server" initiates a gRPC connection *to* that data source.
    *   **Managed by `RuntimeManager`:** This discovery and connection logic is also typically managed within a Tsercom `Runtime` via the `RuntimeManager`.

*   **`RuntimeDataHandler` as the Bridge:**
    *   On both the "Client" (data source) and "Server" (aggregator) sides, a `RuntimeDataHandler` (or a custom implementation of its base class) acts as the crucial bridge. It facilitates the exchange of data and commands between the application's main business logic (e.g., your data generation algorithm or data analysis code) and the isolated Tsercom communication runtime.

### Benefits of this Architecture:

This "client-advertises, server-discovers" approach offers several advantages:

*   **Dynamic Discovery:** Data sources can join (or leave) the network, and the aggregator will automatically discover and connect to them (or handle their disappearance) without manual reconfiguration. This is ideal for environments with ephemeral or mobile nodes.
*   **Resilience to Network Changes:** Data sources can change IP addresses or ports (e.g., due to DHCP or dynamic port assignment). As long as they can re-advertise via mDNS, the aggregator can re-discover and reconnect to them.
*   **Decoupling:** Data producers (Tsercom "Clients") and consumers (Tsercom "Servers") are highly decoupled. They only need to agree on the service definition and the discovery mechanism, not on static network locations.
*   **Scalability:** New data sources can be easily added to the system. They simply start advertising themselves, and the aggregator(s) can discover and integrate them. Similarly, multiple aggregators can discover the same set of data sources.

### Simpler Models Still Viable:

It's important to note that Tsercom still fully supports traditional client-server models where the client initiates a connection to a well-known server address, as shown in the Quick Start. This is perfectly suitable for simpler applications or when dynamic discovery is not a requirement.

However, adopting the "client-advertises, server-discovers" architecture with `RuntimeManager`, `InstancePublisher`, and `InstanceListener` unlocks Tsercom's more advanced capabilities for building robust, scalable, and adaptive distributed systems for time-series data communication.
