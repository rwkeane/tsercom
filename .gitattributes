# Set default behavior to automatically handle text files.
# Git will store text files with LF endings in the repo and, on checkout,
# convert them to the OS-native line endings.
* text=auto

# Explicitly declare file types that should always be treated as text
# and have their line endings normalized.
*.py text
*.md text
*.toml text
*.yml text
*.yaml text
*.txt text
*.json text
*.proto text

# For files that must have LF endings (e.g., shell scripts)

# For files that should be treated as binary and never changed
# Add any binary file extensions you have.
