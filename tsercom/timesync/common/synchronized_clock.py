    """
    An abstract base class for clocks that provide time synchronization.

    This class defines a common interface for obtaining the current synchronized
    time (`now` property) and for converting timestamps between the local system's
    naive datetime representation and a `SynchronizedTimestamp` (which represents
    time in a synchronized domain, typically aligned with a server or a common
    reference time).

    Subclasses must implement the `sync` and `desync` methods to define the
    specific logic for how local time is mapped to synchronized time and vice-versa.

    def now(self) -> SynchronizedTimestamp:
        """
        Gets the current time as a SynchronizedTimestamp.

        This property provides the current time, adjusted by the clock's
        synchronization logic (as implemented in the `sync` method).

        Returns:
            A SynchronizedTimestamp representing the current synchronized time.

        Converts a SynchronizedTimestamp to a local naive datetime.datetime object.

        This method takes a timestamp that is considered to be in the
        synchronized time domain and converts it back to the local system's
        naive datetime representation, effectively removing any synchronization
        offset or adjustment applied by this clock.

            time: The SynchronizedTimestamp to desynchronize.
