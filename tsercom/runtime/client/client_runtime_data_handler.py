"""Implements the client-side specific `RuntimeDataHandler` logic.

This module defines `ClientRuntimeDataHandler`, a concrete implementation of
`RuntimeDataHandlerBase` tailored for Tsercom runtimes operating in a client role.
It is responsible for managing client-specific aspects of data flow,
caller registration (typically of remote servers or services it connects to),
and time synchronization with those remote entities.

    This class extends `RuntimeDataHandlerBase` to provide functionality
    specific to client runtimes. A key responsibility is managing time
    synchronization with each connected remote endpoint (server/service). It uses a
    `TimeSyncTracker` to establish and maintain synchronized clocks for each
    caller (remote endpoint) it registers.

    When registering a caller (representing a connection to a remote server),
    it initiates time synchronization for that server\'s endpoint and uses the
    resulting synchronized clock when creating the `EndpointDataProcessor` for
    that caller. Similarly, it notifies the `TimeSyncTracker` upon unregistering
    a caller.
