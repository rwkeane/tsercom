"""Implements the server-side specific `RuntimeDataHandler` logic.

This module defines `ServerRuntimeDataHandler`, a concrete implementation of
`RuntimeDataHandlerBase` tailored for Tsercom runtimes operating in a server role.
It is responsible for managing server-specific aspects of data flow and caller
registration. A key characteristic is that it typically acts as the source of
truth for time, providing a synchronized clock for its clients, often through
a `TimeSyncServer`.
