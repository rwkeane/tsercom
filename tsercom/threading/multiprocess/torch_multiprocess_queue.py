    A multiprocess queue specialized for torch.Tensor objects, using
    torch.multiprocessing.Queue.

    This queue implements the standard BaseMultiprocessQueue interface
    (put/get with Envelopes) and also provides specialized put_tensor/get_tensor
    methods for raw tensor handling, as expected by TensorQueueProto.

    Internally, it might use one or more torch.multiprocessing.Queue instances.
    For get_tensor(correlation_id), it needs a way to retrieve specific tensors.
    This suggests tensors are stored with their correlation_ids.

        # This internal queue will store raw tensors, perhaps with correlation ID if get_tensor needs it.
        # For get_tensor(correlation_id) to work efficiently, we can't just use a simple mp.Queue.
        # Option 1: mp.Queue stores (correlation_id, tensor). get_tensor iterates or uses a manager. (Inefficient for get_tensor)
        # Option 2: mp.Queue stores tensors, get_tensor is not by specific ID but FIFO for that queue.
        #           This matches how AggregatingQueue uses it: meta_env = data_q.get(), then tensor = tensor_q.get_tensor(meta_env.id)
        #           This implies the tensor_q itself might not need the ID for retrieval if it's paired 1:1.
        #           However, the TensorQueueProto has get_tensor(correlation_id, ...).
        #
        # Let's assume TorchMultiprocessQueue used by AggregatingQueue is *the* queue for tensors,
        # and it receives tensors via put_tensor(tensor, id) and retrieves them via get_tensor(id).
        # This requires an internal mechanism to map correlation_id to tensors.
        # A simple mp.Queue won't do for random access by correlation_id.
        #
        # This could be a managed dictionary or multiple queues.
        # For now, let's use a dictionary managed by the torch mp manager.
        # This requires the factory (TorchMultiprocessQueueFactory) to set up a manager
        # and pass the managed dict proxy, or this queue starts its own (less ideal).
        #
        # Simpler approach for now, assuming get_tensor doesn't need random access by ID from *this* queue object itself,
        # but that the correlation ID is for the *consumer* to match.
        # If the TensorQueueProto implies this queue handles the ID matching, it's more complex.
        #
        # The AggregatingQueue's get path:
        # 1. meta_envelope = self._underlying_data_queue.get()
        # 2. tensor_data = self._underlying_tensor_queue.get_tensor(meta_envelope.correlation_id, ...)
        # This implies that get_tensor on _underlying_tensor_queue *does* use correlation_id.
        #
        # This means the TorchMultiprocessQueue needs to internally handle this mapping.
        # This is not trivial with standard torch.multiprocessing.Queue.
        #
        # Possible implementations for get_tensor(correlation_id):
        # 1. Have a manager.dict() mapping correlation_id to mp.Queue(1) for each tensor. (Complex to manage lifecycle)
        # 2. A single queue stores (correlation_id, tensor). get_tensor() would then have to fetch, check ID, requeue if not match. (Bad)
        # 3. The `TorchMultiprocessQueueFactory` when it creates `create_tensor_queues`
        #    actually returns a more complex setup where the tensor queue is implicitly
        #    linked to the metadata queue, or the `get_tensor` is a call to a shared service.
        #
        # Let's assume the simplest model that might work: a single torch.mp.Queue.
        # The `get_tensor` will take an ID but might ignore it if the queue is just FIFO.
        # This would mean the `TensorQueueProto` is slightly misleading for this implementation.
        # Or, the `correlation_id` in `get_tensor` is a hint or for a shared resource not solely this queue.
        #
        # Given the existing code for `TorchMultiprocessQueueFactory` (not shown but implied by prior steps),
        # it likely just creates a standard `torch.mp.Queue`.
        # Let's proceed with that assumption and see if tests reveal issues with correlation.
        # The `put_tensor` will store (correlation_id, tensor) and `get_tensor` will retrieve and verify.
