"""
Provides a factory function for creating multiprocess queue pairs.

This module contains the `create_multiprocess_queues` factory function,
which is responsible for instantiating and returning a connected pair of
`MultiprocessQueueSink` and `MultiprocessQueueSource` objects. These objects
serve as wrappers around a shared `multiprocessing.Queue`, facilitating
inter-process communication by providing distinct interfaces for sending (sink)
and receiving (source) data.
