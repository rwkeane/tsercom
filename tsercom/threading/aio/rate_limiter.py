"""Provides asynchronous rate-limiting mechanisms for asyncio applications.

This module defines an abstract base class `RateLimiter` and provides
concrete implementations:
  - `RateLimiterImpl`: A standard rate limiter that enforces a minimum time
    interval between operations.
  - `NullRateLimiter`: A no-op rate limiter that imposes no restrictions.
