"""Provides a generic, asynchronous polling mechanism.

This module defines the `AsyncPoller` class, which allows one or more producers
to make items available and one or more consumers to asynchronously await
and retrieve these items in batches. It is designed for scenarios where items
may arrive sporadically and consumers need an efficient way to wait for them
without blocking.

Key features include:
- Thread-safe submission of items via `on_available`.
- Asynchronous iteration (`async for`) for consumers to retrieve batches of items.
- Optional rate limiting to control the frequency of polling/yielding batches.
- A bounded internal queue to prevent excessive memory consumption.
- An explicit `stop()` method to terminate the poller and release waiting consumers.
