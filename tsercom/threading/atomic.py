"""Provides generic `Atomic[AtomicTypeT]` for thread-safe value access.

This module defines the `Atomic` class, which wraps a value of a generic type
`AtomicTypeT` and ensures that read (`get`) and write (`set`) operations on this
value are performed atomically via `threading.Lock`. Suitable for
sharing simple values between multiple threads without explicit locking
at the call site.
