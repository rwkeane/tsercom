"""Manages dynamic service discovery and establishes connections to discovered services.

This module provides the `ServiceConnector` class, which acts as a bridge between
a `ServiceSource` (which discovers services) and a `ConnectionFactory` (which
establishes connections, typically gRPC channels). The `ServiceConnector` listens
for newly discovered services, attempts to connect to them, and notifies its
client upon successful connection. It also handles marking connections as failed
to allow for re-discovery and re-connection.

    uses the provided `ConnectionFactory` to attempt to establish a connection
    (e.g., a gRPC channel) to it.
