async def test_has_id():
    """
    Tests the has_id() method logic.
    The method `has_id()` in `CallerIdentifierWaiter` is actually `return self.__caller_id is None`.
    So, `has_id()` is True if `__caller_id` is None (i.e., ID has *not* been set yet).
    `has_id()` is False if `__caller_id` is not None (i.e., ID *has* been set).
    The test description seems to have the True/False conditions inverted relative to this typical interpretation.
    Let's assume the method name `has_id` means "does it currently possess/hold an ID?".
    No, the prompt says: `Assert await waiter.has_id() is True (since __caller_id is initially None)`.
    This means the method name `has_id` is interpreted as "is the ID slot available?" or "is it waiting for an ID?".
    If `__caller_id` is `None`, it means it doesn't *have* the ID yet, it's waiting.
    The prompt states: `has_id()` is `True` (since `__caller_id` is initially `None`). This means `has_id()` actually checks `self.__caller_id is None`.
    And then: `set_caller_id(cid)`. `Assert await waiter.has_id() is False (since __caller_id is now set)`.
    This confirms `has_id` should be `self.__caller_id is None`.
