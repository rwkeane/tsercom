    This class serves as a central coordinator for initializing, starting, and
    monitoring Tsercom runtimes. Users register `RuntimeInitializer` instances,
    and the manager then uses appropriate factories (`LocalRuntimeFactoryFactory`
    or `SplitRuntimeFactoryFactory`) to create and launch these runtimes.

    Key functionalities include:
    - Registering runtime initializers and providing `Future` objects for their
      corresponding `RuntimeHandle`s.
    - Starting runtimes either in the same process (sharing an event loop) or
      in a new, isolated process (for out-of-process execution).
    - Monitoring for exceptions from managed runtimes via a `ThreadWatcher`
      (for in-process) or a `SplitProcessErrorWatcherSource` (for out-of-process).
    - Providing methods to check for exceptions or block until an exception occurs.
    - Handling shutdown of created processes and error watchers.
